Key concepts
Text generation models
OpenAI's text generation models (often referred to as generative pre-trained transformers or "GPT" models for short), like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, have been trained to understand natural and formal language. Models like GPT-4 allows text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to these models are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you "program" a model like GPT-4, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. Models like GPT-4 can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more. Read more in our introductory text generation guide and in our prompt engineering guide.

Assistants
Assistants refer to entities, which in the case of the OpenAI API are powered by large language models like GPT-4, that are capable of performing tasks for users. These assistants operate based on the instructions embedded within the context window of the model. They also usually have access to tools which allows the assistants to perform more complex tasks like running code or retrieving information from a file. Read more about assistants in our Assistants API Overview.

Embeddings
An embedding is a vector representation of a piece of data (e.g. some text) that is meant to preserve aspects of its content and/or its meaning. Chunks of data that are similar in some way will tend to have embeddings that are closer together than unrelated data. OpenAI offers text embedding models that take as input a text string and produce as output an embedding vector. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, classification, and more. Read more about embeddings in our embeddings guide.

Tokens
Text generation and embeddings models process text in chunks called tokens. Tokens represent commonly occurring sequences of characters. For example, the string " tokenization" is decomposed as " token" and "ization", while a short and common word like " the" is represented as a single token. Note that in a sentence, the first token of each word typically starts with a space character. Check out our tokenizer tool to test specific strings and see how they are translated into tokens. As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text.

One limitation to keep in mind is that for a text generation model the prompt and the generated output combined must be no more than the model's maximum context length. For embeddings models (which do not output tokens), the input must be shorter than the model's maximum context length. The maximum context lengths for each text generation and embeddings model can be found in the model index.

The Chat Completions endpoint powers ChatGPT and provides a simple way to take text as input and use a model like GPT-4 to generate an output.

Want to jump straight to the code?
Skip the quickstart and dive into the API reference.

This quickstart is designed to help get your local development environment setup and send your first API request. If you are an experienced developer or want to just dive into using the OpenAI API, the API reference of GPT guide are a great place to start. Throughout this quickstart, you will learn:

How to setup your development environment
How to install the latest SDKs
Some of the basic concepts of the OpenAI API
How to send your first API request
If you run into any challenges or have questions getting started, please join our developer forum.

Account setup
First, create an OpenAI account or sign in. Next, navigate to the API key page and "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.

Quickstart language selection
Select the tool or language you want to get started using the OpenAI API with.

Python is a popular programming language that is commonly used for data applications, web development, and many other programming tasks due to its ease of use. OpenAI provides a custom Python library which makes working with the OpenAI API in Python simple and efficient.

Step 1: Setup Python
Install Python
Setup a virtual environment (optional)
Install the OpenAI Python library
Step 2: Setup your API key
Setup your API key for all projects (recommended)
Setup your API key for a single project
Step 3: Sending your first API request
Making an API request
After you have Python configured and an API key setup, the final step is to send a request to the OpenAI API using the Python library. To do this, create a file named openai-test.py using th terminal or an IDE.

Inside the file, copy and paste one of the examples below:

ChatCompletions

ChatCompletions
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts with creative flair."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a poem that explains the concept of recursion in programming."}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
To run the code, enter python openai-test.py into the terminal / command line.

The Chat Completions example highlights just one area of strength for our models: creative ability. Explaining recursion (the programming topic) in a well formatted poem is something both the best developers and best poets would struggle with. In this case, gpt-3.5-turbo does it effortlessly.

Whisper
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification. The Whisper v2-large model is currently available through our API with the whisper-1 model name.

Currently, there is no difference between the open source version of Whisper and the version available through our API. However, through our API, we offer an optimized inference process which makes running Whisper through our API much faster than doing it through other means. For more technical details on Whisper, you can read the paper.

Embeddings
Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relatedness between two pieces of text. Our second generation embedding model, text-embedding-ada-002 is a designed to replace the previous 16 first-generation embedding models at a fraction of the cost. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks. You can read more about our latest embedding model in the announcement blog post.

Moderation
The Moderation models are designed to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies. The models provide classification capabilities that look for content in the following categories: hate, hate/threatening, self-harm, sexual, sexual/minors, violence, and violence/graphic. You can find out more in our moderation guide.

Moderation models take in an arbitrary sized input that is automatically broken up into chunks of 4,096 tokens. In cases where the input is more than 32,768 tokens, truncation is used which in a rare condition may omit a small number of tokens from the moderation check.

The final results from each request to the moderation endpoint shows the maximum value on a per category basis. For example, if one chunk of 4K tokens had a category score of 0.9901 and the other had a score of 0.1901, the results would show 0.9901 in the API response since it is higher.
